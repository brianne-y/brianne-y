## 👨‍💻 Featured Projects

### [Azure & Active Directory: My "Company in the Cloud" Lab](https://github.com/brianne-y/azure-active-directory-lab)
* **The Goal:** I built a mini-corporate office using Microsoft Azure. I set up a server to act as the "brain" of the network and managed a group of fake users.
* **What I Learned:** I practiced the full "User Lifecycle" which is basically the process of hiring someone (onboarding), giving them the right "keys" to the folders they need (**Least Privilege**), and making sure they can log in safely.
* **Problem Solving:** I spent time fixing login errors and setting up "Office Rules" (GPOs) to keep the environment secure.

### [Jira & Confluence: My "Help Desk" Lab](https://github.com/brianne-y/jira-confluence-itsm-lab)
* **The Goal:** I created a professional Help Desk system where users can ask for help when their tech breaks.
* **What I Learned:** I used a "Shift-Left" strategy—which is just a fancy way of saying I wrote helpful "How-to" guides in **Confluence** so users can fix small problems themselves.
* **Efficiency:** I set up timers (SLAs) to make sure I finish my work on time and built automated workflows so the system stays organized.
